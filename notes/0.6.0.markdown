### GhpagesPlugin

sbt-ghpages 0.6.0 migrates the plugin to AutoPlugin.

    lazy val root = (project in file("."))
      .enablePlugins(GhpagesPlugin)

Following the Plugin Best Practices guide, the key names are now prefixed with `ghpages`.
Note that previously keys were wrapped in `GhPagesKeys` object.
For example, `GhPagesKeys.repository` is now called `ghpagesRepository`.

To import the keys in `project/*.scala`, use the following import clause:

    import com.typesafe.sbt.sbtghpages.GhpagesPlugin, GhpagesPlugin.autoImport._

### ghpagesBranch setting

`ghpagesBranch` contains the name of the branch in which to put site data.
The purpose of this setting is to let people use sbt-ghpages for GitLab etc with very little additional configuration.

### includeFilter in ghpagesCleanSite

`ghpagesCleanSite` now respects `includeFilter` and `excludeFilter` to protect existing site.
This is useful when sbt-ghpages is responsible for a versioned slice of the web site.
See [Protecting Existing Files](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages#protecting-existing-files) for more details.
